Grape Leavs

as someone may consider this a poor people food (to eat trees leavs) as even not all arabs know about this recipe and can't imagin how wonderful it is, i will just try to discripe it.

th leaves are washed and i guess boiled (i never did it myslef, always was lucky that someone made it for me, the best are what my mother do ofcours, but my sister and my wife still great), a filling is prepared that contains rice (dahhh, Arabic food, sure to have rice) and grounded beaf and Coriander (called Kuzbara or Chinese parsley) with seasoning, th leaves are then one by one (in case some are broken or so small, u can compine 2) will be laid on a table and small amount of the filling is put on it, then you will role the papers to be in finger shape (think of it like spring role, only u use the leaves instead of bastry, and different filling).

easy ha? the problem you will need to do this for the reset of the leaves (i guess 10 per person may seems logic, but people likely to fall in love with this they will eat more) and then put them into cook pane, i advice to put some potato slices in the bottom of the pane with some chicken wings as this will prevent the leaves from being burned by mistake.

u will put tomato juice (i think deluted by chicken soup) and cook the whole thing for 1 1/2 hour.

there is a cold version (the Yalangi) that have something to do with oil, but i don't know what exatly and it is served cold as appatizers.

bon appetit

p.s. sry for bad english, im too lazy to correct my recipe on MS word.
